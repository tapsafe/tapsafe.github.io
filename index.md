Tapsafe's goal is to develop a simple and secure TOTP system.

Time-based One-time Passwords often known via Google Authenticator are a valuable second factor in many
security situations.
However thier very success is causing usability issues with overly long lists of accounts and frequent access driving down user acceptance.
As with all security issues balancing convienice is vital to prevent undermining.

We strongly belive in transparency and verifyable security
