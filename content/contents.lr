body:

Tapsafeâ€™s goal is to develop a simple and secure TOTP system.

Time-based One-time Passwords often known via Google Authenticator are a valuable second factor in many security situations.
However their very success is causing usability issues with overly long lists of accounts and frequent
access driving down user acceptance.
As with all security issues balancing convince is vital to prevent undermining.

We strongly believe in transparency and verifiable security
